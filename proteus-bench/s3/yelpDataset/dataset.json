The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure.  Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning.

I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.  It was amazing.\n\nWhile EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.  It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.

It goes to show you, you can please everyone. They are probably griping about something that their own fault...there are many people like that.\n\nIn any case, my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday. It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small \"Here's The Beef\" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11\" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!\n\nWe had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So, everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that  you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZRJwVLyzEJq1VAihDhYiow"}

Full windows and earthy wooden walls give a feeling of warmth inside this restaurant perched in the middle of a farm.  The restaurant seemed fairly full even on a Tuesday evening; we had secured reservations just a couple days before.\n\nMy friend and I had sampled sandwiches at the Farm Kitchen earlier that week, and were impressed enough to want to eat at the restaurant.  The crisp, fresh veggies didn't disappoint: we ordered the salad with orange and grapefruit slices and the crudites to start.  Both were very good; I didn't even know how much I liked raw radishes and turnips until I tried them with their pesto and aioli sauces.\n\nFor entrees, I ordered the lamb and my friend ordered the pork shoulder.  Service started out very good, but trailed off quickly.  Waiting for our food took a very long time (a couple seated after us received and finished their entrees before we received our's), and no one bothered to explain the situation until the maitre'd apologized almost 45 minutes later.  Apparently the chef was unhappy with the sauce on my entree, so he started anew.  This isn't really a problem, but they should have communicated this to us earlier.  For our troubles, they comped me the glass of wine I ordered, but they forgot to bring out with my entree  as I had requested.  Also, they didn't offer us bread, but I will echo the lady who whispered this to us on her way out: ask for the bread.  We received warm foccacia, apple walnut, and pomegranate slices of wonder with honey and butter.  YUM.\n\nThe entrees were both solid, but didn't quite live up to the innovation and freshness of the vegetables.  My lamb's sauce was delicious, but the meat was tough.  Maybe the vegetarian entrees are the way to go?  But our dessert, the gingerbread pear cake, was yet another winner.\n\nIf the entrees were tad more inspired, or the service weren't so spotty, this place definitely would have warranted five stars.  If I return, I'd like to try the 75$ tasting menu.  Our bill came out to about 100$ for two people, including tip, no drinks.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-yxfBYGB6SEqszmxJxd97A"}

After I ate here I had to go back the next day for more.

While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the \"Grand Opening\" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy!  A new place to try!\n\nIt looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor, smell and cleanliness inside.  I ordered dinner for two, to go.  The menu was awesome.  I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.  It made it difficult to choose something.  Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!\n\nAs if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!  I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah.  There's a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar, it's amazing.

I was pleasantly surprised! The store had a good amount of parking, and the store front was clean, open and had adequate seating around the perimeters. There were already 5-6 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished, and 2 people waiting infront of me to see a representative. All the guys working there were busy helping someone, yet were saying hello to us and reassuring they'd get to us very soon. I didn't wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by Wally. He inspected my tires, recommended a plan of action gave me options, and we headed back into the store. After I made my decision to replace 2 of the tires, he checked their stock, and unfortunately they didn't have them there. BUT he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning, so I could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed. Great! The prices were not as heafty (relief), and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced, it took exactly the amount of time they'd told me (45 min). They apologized for the wait, but no need for that! The guy who helped me on the 2nd day (I'm sorry I forgot his name) was also very professional and great. I recommend this store and will be bringing my car here in the future most definitely. Thanks, guys!\n\nTIP: If you know you need to bring your car in, you can make an appointment with them online.

I thought to myself, \"how nice\", they read my review and they are concerned about the quality of their product.  I think that is admirable.  I did not take them up on the offer, because I don't feel that would be appropriate - I'm interested in doing yelp reviews because I have benefitted from reading the reviews of others, and I want to share my thoughts and feelings too :-) - I'm not looking for freebies.\n\nSo, anyway, last friday seemed like a good day to walk over to LGO and see what's shakin.  I grabbed my growler jug (still the best deal around) and the wife, called a friend to join us for a beer and walked on down to the corner.  The evening was a bit on the warm side, but it was quiet and about the normal buzz of busyness for this corner.  It's always kinda crazy and we like to sit on the patio to watch the manic drivers race around trying to find parking.  We went into the store and the wife ordered a grilled-fish sandwich.  I nervously ordered a cheeseburger with fries.  After placing our orders and getting warned that we needed to be around to pick them up, I moseyed over to the bar to get my jug filled with Stella.  Did I mention that this is an awesome deal?  So, we got some glasses and headed out to the patio.  Soon afterward, they called our name and we got our grub.  My wife's fish sandwich was consumed with muffled oooh's and ahhhhs', and she raved about the perfect texture, grilled flavor and delicious, fresh multi-grain bread.  She also raved about the slaw that came with it.  I think she liked this sandwich.  The burger, on the other hand, is still a disappointment.  I ordered it Medium Rare (the only way to order a burger) and kudos to the woman for not warning me about undercooked meats - I'm aware.  really. And I asked for cheese and put it on a hamburger bun.  It came open-faced with a pile of coarsly shredded mild cheddar cheese.  It had the appropriate veggies - lettuce, pickle and tomato, red onion slices and the special sauce.  With a pile of limp matchstick fries on the side, it was a big pile-o-food.  The portion was impressive.  That's about where it ended for me.  The burger was overcooked and the pile of shredded cheese is a bit off-putting.  It's impressive, I'll give 'em that, but a big pile of cold, shredded cheese just doesn't work for me.  The cheese needs to be melted.  A good burger has the cheese melted.  at least some.  Lot's of cheese can be fun, but it overpowers the rest of the flavors and tends to cool the burger quickly.  I scraped off about two-thirds of the cheese - enough to make a cheese crisp if I had a tortilla, and put the burger together.  Flavor was so-so.  After I added some salt and pepper, flavor was just a little better than so-so.  Burger was cooked to med-well, but still juicy.  The veggies were fresh and crispy.  A side of mayo for dipping the fries in is required for me.  I like my fries Belgian style.  The bun was a little dry and on the edge of stale, but not bad enough that I could not eat it still.  Overall, I stand by my original review of the burgers here.  I realize LGO is trying to stand out with a \"different\" presentation, and I applaud the effort, but I think it needs a bit more work to stand out at a time when everybody is doing burgers.  The fries were sub-par, limp and forgettable.  The ambiance, however, is what brings us back.  Sitting on the corner patio, sipping a beer, having a great conversation and watching the show all around me is a great way to wind down on a warm Friday night.  LGO - keep working on the burger, I'll keep coming in, but I think I'll stick with the wings for now.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7SO_rX1F6rQEl-5s3wZxgQ"}

Check\nBest thing that I have eaten in the last year?  Check\n\nI have to say, not the best fried chicken I have ever had, but pretty damn good- it could use more seasoning.  Now the waffles, probably the best ever...  The waffles are deliciously soft inside, a little crispy out with a wonderful cinammoness to them.  The seating is cramped, but it doesn't matter as soon as your food is delivered your table goes quiet, you get tunnel vision and after the first bite you are taken away to an orgy of goodness.\n\nIf you are in Phoenix, this is a requirement.  Come real early or be prepared to wait.  Don't forget to order the Red Velvet cake and they have Kool-Aid if that fits your fancy.

I'm on a constant quest to find that  Ideal expressed in Real Life. \n\nVintage 95 isn't quite there, but it's damn close. If I ever give something Five Stars, you'll know it has pegged my Platonic Ideal. Anyway...\n\nThe plan last night was for drinks. No plans for food, just Adult Beverages and warm conversation. But it turned into more.\n\nThe location in downtown Chandler is terrific for us. The owners have created a very fine visual experience - leather, stone, dark woods, good lighting. And they don't have the music turned up so loud that you CANNOT HAVE A CONVERSATION. This is one of my pet peeves. If I want to stare at people move their mouths while enduring an aural assault, I'll stand on the deck of an aircraft carrier. When I go out with friends, I want to enjoy their company AND their conversation. Is that concept so difficult to grasp? [/rant off]\n\nThe atmosphere at Vintage 95 is very close to my Ideal. I'd go back just to sit on the leather couches in front of the fireplace, and then go back another time to sit on the leather stools at the bar, and then go back about fourteen more times to sit out on the patio. Seriously - go check out the patio. It is EXACTLY what a Patio Hangout Bar should be. EXACTLY.\n\nCaroline and I told the hostesses we were only there for drinks, so we were seated in the bar area in some fabulous leather club chairs. It wasn't initmate, but we weren't looking for intimate. And speaking of the bar, even though V95 advertises itself as a wine bar, they DO have booze. I'm not much of a wine drinker and was very pleased to see that they carried a pretty good selection of single malt scotches. Not an overwhelming selection, but well beyond the normal Glenfiddich /Glenlivit /GlenMorangie trio to which most places are limited. I had a couple of drums of Ardbeg, which is one of my new favorites and very reasonably priced at retail. (Scotch is never reasonably priced in restaurants, but I was celebrating so I didn't care.) Caroline had her normal \"vodka martini extra dirty extra cold\" which she judged to have \"perfect dirtiness\", (no wonder I love her!), perfect amount of olives and very cold. \n\nThe limited Happy Hour menu had some very interesting choices. We settled on the bruschetta and the smoked tomato bisque. The bruschetta was VERY nice and quite unusual. You get to select four of eight choices for your bruschetta platter; we picked: (1) white bean and pancetta, (2) gravlax, caper goat cheese and pickled onions, (3) fig chutney, ricotta and prosciutto, (4) brie, pear and onion jam. They were all served cold, in nice sized portions and the flavors were all nicely balanced and very interesting. Caroline would have preferred the bread to not be so crispy, but I really liked it. The tomato bisque  was creamy, smoky and had well-balanced flavor. Caroline said it was unique and I say it was just darn delicious. \n\nThings being as they are, drinks and appetizers turned into food. A friend had told us \"you have to try the Vintage burger\", so we did. It came served with a mixture of regular and sweet potato fries, all nicely cooked and nicely seasoned. Recommended. The burger was VERY tasty. They obviously use good beef, the bun was fresh, the fixin's were tasty. HIGHLY recommended.\n\nIn for a dime, in for a dollar, right? So we ordered dessert. Again, the dessert menu is short, but I'm okay with that as long as they do it well. Chocolate torte with hazelnut gelato, apple pie with carmel sauce and creme fraiche gelato, and something else we couldn't remember. I'm allergic to hazelnut and don't like sweet desserts, so we decided to try the apple pie.\n\nLike everything else we had sampled, the apple pie was unusual - you wouldn't find it anywhere else. It was served on a freshly baked puff pastry, cubed apples served on top and inside - tender but not mushy -  with lots of cinnamon and sugar, plate was swirled with salted dolce la leche. It was tasty, but instead of the expected creme fraiche gelato, we were served hazelnut gelato. I didn't realize it was hazelnut until I'd had a couple of bites and my throat started to swell up.\n\nAt this point that the night could have turned into a disaster, but to their credit - it didn't. We told the waiter who told the manager, (Gavin - one of the owners), who immediately came and asked if I needed emergency assistance. I didn't, I'm not THAT allergic.)  Frankly, their response was EXACTLY the kind of customer service you want to see. Anyone can make a mistake, so no harm, no foul. But I must give BIG Kudos to Gavin for his kindness, attention to detail and outstanding customer service.\n\nWe will DEFINTELY be back and I strongly recommend you put it on your list too.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FCcFT610nQBVcRdY-devQA"}

The entree was good too, but there were bites of just bread with no chicken in the panini.  It definitely would have been better with more chicken!\n\nBut the girl working here is one of the worst waitress/bartender/hostesses EVER!\n\nWhen we walked in, she didn't even sit us.  We stood there forever waiting until she finally told us to seat ourselves.  We went outside since there was nothing left inside.  It was too hot outside so we came back in and figured we'd sit at the bar.  Luckily a nice guy noticed us looking around and let us sit at the end of his table that he moved apart since his whole party didn't show up for dinner.\n\nI was so excited when I saw they had cider on their menu!  And not just one, but two that I like!  Wyder's Pear Cider and Strongbow!!  \nI ordered a Wyder's.  After I finished it and asked for another, she said they were out of them.  Okay, so I ordered a strongbow.  She came back and poured it into a glass for me.  When I took a drink it was disgusting!!  It was Boddington's!!!!  When I finally got her attention away from flirting with a man sitting at the bar to ask her for the correct drink, she told me they were out of Strongbow too!  How are you out of both drinks??  You're a restaurant.  Shouldn't it be stocked?  You're right across from a BevMo for god's sake!\n\nWhen we ordered our food, he ordered the app.  Then I ordered my entree and she walked away!  She didn't even get his order!!!!  We figured it was probably for the best.  We'd split the app and the entree and eat less.  Stupid of the waitress to lose money that way, but whatever.\n\nWhen she brought my food, she didn't bring the correct things.  How hard is it to remember?  She had maybe 4 tables to take care of!  Maybe if she stopped texting while she's behind the bar on her cell phone or if she'd stop having a conversation with the guy at the bar, maybe she could have done her job a little better.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tA2DT7CGQPzgA6tTcTkXDw"}

Reminiscent of a trendy hipster coffee joint, this is actually a casual vegan restaurant. \n\nI am a pescatarian and unless I am eating seafood, I steer clear of meat, even the mock kind usually however once in a while it's delicious... so why try it here at Green I thought. The menu's style is comfort food, which as we all know traditionally is heavy on the meat, sauces, and fat content... so at least if you're going to be bad, you can do it with organic and pure ingredients.\n\n\nSo as I wanted to sample as much of the menu as possible, my lovely friend, her fiance, and I shared a few items:\n\n*Artichoke Gratine: The corn chips were amazing, lightly salted and crisp. The dip was a bit too garlicky and runny for my liking. Ate a few bites of this but could not see myself eating the entire thing solo.\n\n*Spicy Buffalo \"Wings\": first things first... do not let looks dismay you... true it looks gross but they taste legit! The flavor of the buffalo sauce was perfect, although could have been spicier. And the cucumber ranch dipping sauce was perfectly creamy and lightly flavored as to not overpower the \"wings\". This dish is a must try!!\n\n*Vegan Chili Fries: the fries are thin cut and tasty. The chili sauce was good, at first, but I quickly got sick of the flavor. This could be because I was never a huge chili fan even back when I ate meat. Hmm, I think you are better off ordering the thyme fries.\n\n*Crab Puffs: Perfectly crisp with a delicious creamy filling. Another must try!\n\nLastly my friend's fiance ordered that day's special which was a green chili burrito... delicious and huge. A bit too much rice but besides that a great option. It came with a side, which he ordered the curry pasta salad, mmm.\n\n\nGreen serves bowls, sandwiches, pizzas, salads... next time I am back in the area I will be checking out more of the menu when craving \"meat\" and not my usual tofu, seafood, veggie diet.  \n\nMight I add the service is friendly. Perfect place for a casual friend date.", "type": "review", "business_id": "c1yGkETheht_1vjda7G5sA"}

We couldn't decide on what we wnated so we ended up splitting the entree of Blackened Salmon with Apple/Chipotle chutney and some potatoes. We also got three of the small Plates: mini reuben, crispy calamari and cilantro rubbed grilled shrimp. All the food was awesome. The salmon was cooked perfectly, although i think I would have liked the chutney on the side, but that's small fries.

After seeing his body transform to only 16.2% body fat, all his jeans get too big on him and fill out his American Apparel briefs nicely I was super jealous. He raved about his teacher and I could tell he had de-stressed a lot since he started the practice.\n\nLuckily, she opened up a studio recently, and it simply goregous. The waiting area is filled with yoga material and a very calming space with a remodeled bathroom and dressing rooms to change if coming from work/school. Not at all cheesy like the SouthWest Inst with the way too many angels imagery (creepy!). But the gem is truly the practice space. Hardwood floors, high ceilings, a beautiful staircase, tasteful decorations and absolutely NO MIRRORS.  \n\nThat is right- the only person staring at my pudge rolls is my teacher and who-ever isn't focusing on their tree posture-not the entire class! It really relieves a lot of stress  and helps me concentrate on how a posture feels as opposed to just looks.\n\nAs for Tish Hegel, she is simply outstanding-she has so many credentials, you have to read her biography for yourself. She has been practicing for a loooong time, and her hands-on instruction and confident voice echoes in my ears even now (bring those shoulders down!). \n\nSo far, I have done:  Ashtanga Inspired Flow (pretty intense, really hurt for 3 days, would recommend after getting into yoga for a while), Sivananda (ditto),  Focus Class (did a lot of bike riding and she focused on everybody's body issues and did the sequence right then and there for us and my lower back and knees felt amazing the day after) and this morning brought my friend to Kinetic Yoga: Morning Movement and Flow, which kicked our 6am asses a little bit but we both felt amazing afterwards!  She does tons of modifications, is always making sure we are okay, and is just super personable.\n\nI did the huge package since I didn't renew my ASU gym membership for this summer, but you can do drop-in. \n\nNow for the cliched Yoga Review ending: \n\nNAMASTE!", "type": "review", "business_id": "d7_jkx0VPx3uHsUl18iHMQ"}

They have some crazy ingredients like varied sauces and mayos, fresh spinach, grilled peppers, and all sorts of other things you don't see at a typical deli.

On the other side of the coin, their website is horrible and occasionally we find some things missing or not quite right, but we chalk that up to charm and whimsy. (We get a weekly Sacks delivery.)\n\nIf you want a basic ham and cheese sandwich, you can get that here. If you want a sandwich like their Blue Bayou, which is spicy marinated chicken served with bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, cheddar jack, mushrooms, spinach, and chipotle mayo, all melted down, well, you can get that here too, but only on the days when it's a special. \n\nFrom their regular, artist-inspired menu, their Dali is an instant classic take on the egg salad: This one comes with lettuce, bacon, cream cheese, mayo, and tomato, on 12-grain bread. The Encore has prime steak, melted provolone, hot/mild/or mixed peppers, feta yogurt or marinara sauce, lettuce, tomato, and parmesan for $6.30. Seriously, give this place a shot and you won't be disappointed. \n\nOh, and every sandwich comes with a lovely cookie. Brilliant.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Y-NqaDy_1bb-Y5dQ33x-Pw"}

We both had house salads with blue cheese dressing- I think you can tell a lot about the quality of a place by their salads. They used fresh field greens, the tomatoes were perfect and sweet, and even the thinly sliced onions were sweet and delicious. The blue cheese dressing was fantastic, and had actual chunks of blue cheese. I was impressed, for a hotel restaurant. For our entrees, I had the hickory smoked baby back ribs (good, but not phenomenal) and husband ordered the chorizo chicken- I am so glad he shared a bite with me, because it was awesome. I was really wishing I'd gotten that instead of the ribs. Oh, and I especially wanted to mention the asparagus that came with my ribs- tender, cooked just right, and flavorful.

When I came out to see the work they did, I immediately noticed several smudges in the interior which they cleaned after I pointed them out.  Also, I noticed a scratch on the passenger side leather seat and a hole punched in the carpet near the pedals.  Anyone who knows me knows that I am a DETAIL oriented person.  Those defects were not present in my car prior to this job.  To add to this bit of a let-down, a day later my boyfriend and I noticed that they didn't even touch my trunk!  They didn't even bother to vacuum it out!\n\nWhen you advertise on your website \"showroom quality,\" I expect showroom quality.

WTF buy it and go home and let your kids do kart wheels there. EEWH!\n\nThen, those of us who actually purchased books and were trying to peacefully read them were in the cafe' - sitting on their dirty wooden benches - where I guess the servers there think that part of theirs jobs in serving coffee is to do a drum solo every time they empty the used coffee grinds into the trash can - which was about every 5 minutes. Yeesh! Luckily, I had my iPod. It was blasting and I still could hear them banging away. It was not a very cleanly area either. \n\nI was going to ask if they had wifi but I just high-tailed it out of there instead. This place is small too and their book selection is limited.\n\nI have been looking for a place to go to read, work and drink some coffee in my area (Arrowhead) and this one is definitely crossed off of my list. \n\nCome here to try and find a book but don't come expecting to kick back and enjoy your novel or what have you. If you like people watching though, this may be your place. There are all kinds here.\n\nPS: and I left my fav coffee mug at this crappy place - like I will go back and get it.

That aside, the food is fantastic and even though it's a bit hard to get out of here for under $30 per person (because you simply must try the cheesecake, and drinks are pushing $14), it's worth it as a classy-but-casual night out that you can really enjoy.\n\nThey have a great patio, the burger is dripping with flavor (and, in fact, cheese), and they have waffle fries with pretty much everything. Great salads and sandwiches help round things out, and they ship their cheesecake in from Carnegie Deli in New York which is just about the most perfect cheesecake you'll have the good chance to try. Forget that Cheesecake Factory nonsense, these people know how a cheesecake is done. It is rich, thick, with just a hint of sour, and an amazing flavor that takes your tongue hostage and demands whipped cream ransom.\n\nOverall, a wonderful place for drinks and good food with friends, and the staff is pointed but efficient and will throw back any shit you give them, in good humor or, as appropriate, not. (We've never run afoul of that rule, but you wouldn't want to, I assure you.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "JhupPnWfNlMJivnWB5druA"}

It may be that I'm spoiled by eating asian food in the Bay Area, but this place just didn't cut it. Unfortunately we both got red curry based dishes, so my experience was fairly limited... I got Duck w/red curry, and was not very impressed at all. The duck was tasty, but the curry was VERY bland. Honestly had I not been told it was curry, I wouldn't really have identified it as curry. The duck came with some plain steamed vegetables on the side, which as the meal went on, served to further water down my already bland curry sauce as the veggie water moved around on the plate. In addition to the curry lacking flavor, the vegetables really needed a boost as well. They should have been stir fried, or been served with a sauce of some sort. \n\nThe service was OK, but not great. There was only one other table in there, and the waitress seemed to forget things, and when we asked her about the meals, I felt like she was giving us canned answers of \"everything is good, just order something so I can go home\". Admittedly it was about 30 or 45 minutes before they closed, so that may have had something to do with it. \n\nIt wasn't a BAD meal by any means. It accomplished the goal of providing nourishment, and was better than bringing mickey D's back to the hotel room, but I won't be going back. The yelp definition of 2 stars is \"Meh. I've experienced better\", and I think that description fits my meal perfectly.", "type": "review", "business_id": "E4b5OC_6mZ0V7B6Nyjncsg"}

A line of blue footprints painted across the concrete floor leads to the men's room, dollar signs to the ATM... genius stuff, really. It wouldn't have been at all out of place were they to have tried selling surfing monkey statues or trotting out a donkey painted like a zebra for an extra special photo opportunity.\n\nRumor had it that Dos Gringos had a killer Sunday brunch buffet and Bloody Mary bar, so we showed up at 10:30 AM to find... that they hadn't opened yet. A place that offers brunch but has the balls to wait until after 11 is okay in my book. Ten bucks gets you all-you-can-eat eggs, bacon, chile verde, beans, and a bunch of other stuff to tickle your fancy. There's nothing like sitting out in the sun, feeding a hangover and resuscitating last night's buzz before the clock strikes noon, and it sure beats sitting in traffic when that monstrosity of a church up the street unleashes some Old Testament fury on Alma School Road. Dos Gringos probably gets spring break wild on Friday night, but on Sunday morning, this place was just as tranquil as the doctor ordered.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RqbSeoeqXTwts5pfhw7nJg"}

I'd found out about Mrs. White's by way of Lo-Lo's, and thought I'd try Mama's food before Son's.  It was good, I'll say that.  I had the smothered chicken and regretted it immensely - fried chicken covered with gravy amounts to a mess of watery breading.  Between that and having to dig through the mess to find the bones, it wasn't exactly a lot of meat down my throat.  Mac & Cheese and white rice as my sides were good.\n\nThe ambiance?  There IS none.  I found more entertainment from the writing on the wall, which had clearly been painted over MANY times since the 60s, and the open/close sign which reads, if closed, to contact \"Jesus\".  LOL.\n\nUnaware of the church across the street, I arrived right after Sunday services to find the place fairly full - some churchgoers, at least one newcomer party, and several regulars.  Based on the caloric content of the entrees, I wasn't surprised to see about 50% obese customers, while the rest were inexplicably thin.\n\nAs a Whitey, I can't say that I was comfortable.  Clientele is almost all Black and while they are some of my best friends, I only felt welcome because of the cordial words spoken by our waiter and the cashier at the checkout, who clearly could have beat the crap out of me with one punch.  Other than that, there were a lot of \"what are YOU doing here?\" looks from fellow customers.  I kept wishing I had brought my sista friend with me, who would have loved this place.\n\nI'd go back, but it's not a perfect choice.  Perhaps on a Saturday when church hadn't just let out.  Also, the price is extreme - it's almost as high as Knott's Berry Farm which gives you more food for only about $2 more, and that's at theme park prices.  This is just dumpy outskirts of downtown..but again, I don't wanna judge.

Later I realized that there was some sort of club or church organization that came in and took over the restaurant so I would recommend making a reservation. The owner was very nice and sat us at one of the reserved tables. Her husband the chief quickly realized we knew nothing about polish food and offered us a sample of dill sour pickle soup. yummmmmy. \n\nThe restaurant itself is located in old town Glendale's Catlin court in a small quaint little house that gives you a more personal ambiance. The owners made us feel like we were literally dinner guest at their house which was not what I was expecting but a nice surprise. \n\nThe food is best described as \"home cooking\". The soup was excellent and my favorite part of the meal but the rest tasted just as my parents would have made growing up at home and I'm not Polish. Put simply all the main ingredients of my dish tasted as though they could have been bought at Fry's and my mom cooked them. The kielbasa was good but nothing unique, sauerkraut was tasty, but the green beans were either overcooked, thawed from frozen, or from a can. I am by no means a Polish food expert and maybe this is exactly how they would make it in Poland? \n\nOverall if you don't feel like cooking, want to try something new, and are in the mood for Polish food I would try it out and see for yourself.

We arrived in the early evening, so I was surprised to see how dark the room would eventually become. I didn't find the table and its decor that exciting, but it will give it a pass.

Half of the party ordered off of the set price menu. This included a three course meal for something like fifty dollars. It may have even been less than that, but I'm not sure. This menu had an array of choices and wasn't limited to chicken or pork. \n\nI was impressed with the portions and the quality. The salads were crisp and the dressing wasn't overpowering, more of an accent, the way it should be. The meat was tender and flavorful; our table ordered the NY, Ribeye and Salmon. I do agree with others who said that the sides were a little small, but I do think they were worth the price. I know for sure the cream of corn was, as it was treated with green chili and a bit of spice. \n\nThe desert was alright. Not a great deal of variety. The textures were spot on, but the temperatures seems a bit off. If a dish was intended to be served warm, it was slightly too cold, etc.\n\nThe service was bad. Probably the worst service I've had at any restaurant. Our server left items off of the tab, forcing her to return and run the debit card three separate times. I am okay with someone making a mistake, but it should not take two attempts to correct. Also, my wife and I ordered Mojitos. They were very average. No sugar, which I assumed was standard fare for Mojiots, and amount of mint was rather low.

Im warning you now, dont ask how much longer after you put your name in if they told you how long when you checked in. \n\nAbout 10am is when it really got packed, just about when we got done. I ordered the chicken and waffles and i really liked it. I asked for some butter for my waffle because it didnt come with any and it made the dish perfect for me. The chicken had great flavor and when you take a bite with the waffle and butter and the syrup, heaven. I tried some bites without the butter and it wasnt even close to be the same for me. \nMy grandma got some omellete and she gave me some because she knew she wouldnt finish it and i would order that also. The omelletes are pretty good size but my wifes dish, my sons and mine where not that much food especially for $9. We are use to getting enough food for 2 when you eat at breakfast places and slighty cheaper. Not complaining because it was good but be ready. \nThere was 2 guys sitting next to use and trying to eat there 30 minute food challange. big ass egg plate with bacon and hash browns, they both only made thru about halfway.  I would definilty go back and get the same stuff. I also got a lemonade with mint and it was just right.

As a hardcore Mexican food enthusiast I was intrigued by the concept but barely able to figure out how this fascinating dish was pronounced.

It definitely was worth the visit to an interesting part of Mesa.\n\nThe restaurant is very similar to a lot of Mexican food restaurants anyone who has lived in Phoenix will be familiar with.  One room with several tables and a counter with interestingly-named dishes posted behind it.  The waitress was very friendly, but I will say that knowing a little Spanish helped.  My girlfriend and I both ordered the Pupusa combo platter, real risky based on other reviews - I know.  I went with Pollo and the revuelta mixed with pork, cheese and beans.  She had the chicken as well with carne asada.  This little dish is fantastic!  I think next time I'll just stick with getting two pupusas because I was extremely full and did NOT need to add rice and beans to the mix (although those were good too.)\n\nThe only disappointment was the fact that Independence Day was on the TV in Spanish, but the volume was too far down to hear.  I'd love to hear the voice-over actor for Will Smith busting out a \"Bienvenidos a Tierra, P***!\"\n\nOn a more serious note, I look forward to heading back here as soon as possible.

Without you, I would have been stuck in Phoenix with no idea of where to find Thai food for lunch that was near a Light Rail station in Tempe!\n\nI arrived at Thai Rama about 11:15 AM.  On entering, there was no indication of waiting to be served and no one visible from the staff, so I selected a table and sat down.  My waitress came to the table and asked if I would be more comfortable at a 2-seat table instead of the 4-seat table I had selected.  Since there were about 25 available tables of various size, I declined and told her I was comfortable where I sat.  There were 3 other tables active in the restaurant, so I did not anticipate the restaurant needing my 4-top before I was done.\n\nThe waitress set the lunch specials menu on the table and went to get a glass of water.  The lunch specials menu had 10 options available, but no Som Tom.  I asked the waitress if Som Tom was available and she answered that she did not know what Som Tom was.  She reached for a full menu as I explained that Som Tom is green papaya salad.  She handed me the menu and directed me to the third page for salads.  There, first on the list, Som Tom.\n\nI ordered Som Tom, the yardstick by which I measure every Thai restaurant, 10 spicy (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes), leaving off the green beans and shrimp, and jasmine rice.  Waitress asked if I wanted anything else to drink, but I said I would stick with water.\n\nAmbience here is pretty plain...and the paper napkins are not of the highest quality.  The decor reminded me of a formula-type restaurant like an Applebees or Chili's...with a hispanic flair.  I observed the chef as he came out of the kitchen and made a loop around the dining room.  As he walked by, I asked in Thai how he was doing.  He stopped and replied that the day was starting off slow, but that it would be busy soon enough.  Then, he continued back on to the kitchen after wishing me a good day.\n\nAbout 5 minutes later, my papaya salad was brought to the table.  Portion size was nice, about 2 1/4 cups.  I took a taste and evaluated a 5 spicy.  When the waitress came to ask if I needed anything, I asked for more chili and lime.  She returned quickly with red chili pepper and sliced lime.  I doctored up the order and fell to with a gusto.  For the price, adequate.  \n\nJasmine rice was about a cup, and not too sticky.  The waitress was good about keeping my water glass full...and in Phoenix, that is important!\n\nOn completing my lunch, I sat and waited for the waitress to bring my bill.  I saw no one for about 10 minutes, then the chef came out of the kitchen and made another round of the dining room.  He asked me (in English) if I enjoyed my salad.  I answered in Thai that it was not spicy enough, and I was surprised he was using red chili instead of Thai chili.  He chuckled and replied that Thai chili was a little more expensive.  I asked for my check and he said he would send the waitress out.\n\nFor the convenience, outstanding!  For the next experience, I will be sure the chef sees me before I place my order.  For the wait on the bill, a little too long.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1621ir5mjVgbHwxCbMAEjg"}

Does that make me the most knowledgeable person on the venue? By all means, no. But, there are some very common themes among the shows I've seen here, even though the artists were different genres, different, crowds, and even different times of year. \n\nThe sound quality is terrible. The last three bands that I have seen there (and have seen in other venues as well) all complained that they couldn't get the sound right on their monitors or in the house. To me, that's a major turn off, if the band isn't happy with their sound, are they going to be very motivated to play? Maybe it's a slighted observation, but it seems that the only bands that return to this venue, are the ones that play music, where the sound quality isn't...let's say \"sacrificed or as important\" (metal, hardcore, thrasher, hip-hop, whatever you call it). \n\nThe venue is also hot. I don't read the reviews of others, before I review a location, because I don't want my opinions to be skewed, but I noticed someone said, \"don't wear pants,\" honestly, that's a really good tip. The last show I saw here was in June. I know, it's Phoenix, in the summer, suck it up. But when you exit the venue and it is noticeably and significantly \"cooler\" than inside the venue, we've got issues, can they not afford to run the a/c? \n\nThe answer to that question is, maybe not. The bar is understaffed, and patrons seem to be lined up 3+ deep, all around. Sometimes you've got to spend money to make money. Hire more bartenders, customers get served faster, thus allowing them more time to consume the beverage and purchase more. That means you can sell more, which means you will make more money! What a concept. \n\nHate to just destroy a business, but hopefully they will heed the feedback constructively. Until then, remember: if you've always wanted to hear the artist you are going to see in a low-fi format, here's your chance, if you have always wanted to forgo wearing those pantaloons, I support you, and finally, you should craft a clever way to hide a flask, since you won't get served, although this might be difficult sans bottoms.", "type": "review", "business_id": "l3yL2rQ6PoFBQ06RLczn9w"}

I have to preface this review with that the owner here is quite lovely and I'm sure has the best intentions, but unfortunately the soup was sorely lacking.  As a proponent of organics, I had my hopes way too high.  Well, first of all it was a bit confusing if we were to order at the counter from a very smudged, unreadable chalk board or if we were to be seated.  The owner appeared from the kitchen and said to have a seat eliminating our initial confusion.  To keep this review to the point, we ordered a smoothie, bland.  A frittata, very small and actually strange as if it might have been cooked in the microwave, need I say more.  Two bowls of soup, one was a bean with kale, unfortunately the beans were not thoroughly cooked and the flavor was not allowed to develop.  The other a red pepper concoction, that another diner suggested, was one dimensional and needed copious amounts of help sprinkled with some love.  \nWhen paying these boutique prices one expects and should get a better quality, culinary creation.  These soups needed proper development and herbal infusions that the kitchen obviously lacks.  I would like to offer a suggestion that may help her, so she can spend more time with the soup prep and less time running around the table up front, and that is to consider a different style of service.  The place is so small that she could have customers order from the chalkboard, if readable, and then deliver the orders.
